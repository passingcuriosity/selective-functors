Functor ⊂ Applicative Functor ⊂ Selective Functor ⊂ Monad
=========================================================

This is code I wrote for a short lightning talk about "Selective Applicative
Functors" at Scala Matsuri 2019. It contains a sketch of part of the functor
hierachy including the new *selective applicative functor* interface described
in the following paper:
